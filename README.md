# Tyro: Thyroid Health Tracker and Predictor

## Project Summary

[Tyro](https://www.ai4goodlab.com/news/project-reports/2022/10/13/tyro-2022-montreal-accelerator-award-winner) is an innovative web application developed by a team at the AI4Good Lab. It's designed to help individuals track and predict their hormone levels, particularly catering to those with thyroid conditions. The project emerged as the 2022 Montreal Accelerator Award winner, distinguishing itself for its predictive capabilities and user-focused approach to health tracking

## Detailed Project Description

Tyro addresses the challenge faced by people with thyroid diseases who generally undergo blood tests every six weeks to monitor hormone levels. By leveraging a combination of ARIMA and Gaussian Process Regression models, Tyro offers intuitive visualizations of past and forecasted hormone levels, aiding users in making better-informed health decisions between doctor visits.

## Impact & Innovation

What sets Tyro apart is its predictive component, which forecasts potential deviations in hormone levels and provides a confidence interval. This foresight enables users to address health issues proactively. Tyro emphasizes transparency and data security, ensuring the responsible handling of sensitive medical data.

## Challenges & Solutions

The project team initially grappled with the lack of a comprehensive dataset. They pivoted to using data from a single individual's past blood tests and planned for future expansion. Challenges around data privacy, ethical considerations, and dataset expansion were thoughtfully navigated, laying a strong foundation for Tyro's future development.

## Learning & Achievements

Participation in the AI4Good Lab fostered a rich learning environment. The team members gained insights into thyroid health, advanced their understanding of AI and ML models, and honed their skills in UI-UX design. Collaborating across different time zones and disciplines, they created a product that addresses a real-world healthcare gap.

## Future Directions

While the original team members are following diverse career paths, they envision numerous enhancements for Tyro, including broader data collection, incorporation of natural language processing, and a community-sharing feature. Prospective collaborators or individuals interested in advancing Tyro can reach out for more information.
