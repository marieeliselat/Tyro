# Tyro: Thyroid Health Tracker and Predictor

## Project Summary

[Tyro](https://www.ai4goodlab.com/news/project-reports/2022/10/13/tyro-2022-montreal-accelerator-award-winner) is an innovative web application developed by a team at the AI4Good Lab. It's designed to help individuals track and predict their hormone levels, particularly catering to those with thyroid conditions. The project emerged as the 2022 Montreal Accelerator Award winner, distinguishing itself for its predictive capabilities and user-focused approach to health tracking

## Technologies Used

## Detailed Project Description

Tyro addresses the challenge faced by people with thyroid diseases who generally undergo blood tests every six weeks to monitor hormone levels. By leveraging a combination of ARIMA and Gaussian Process Regression models, Tyro offers intuitive visualizations of past and forecasted hormone levels, aiding users in making better-informed health decisions between doctor visits.

## Impact & Innovation

What sets Tyro apart is its predictive component, which forecasts potential deviations in hormone levels and provides a confidence interval. This foresight enables users to address health issues proactively. Tyro emphasizes transparency and data security, ensuring the responsible handling of sensitive medical data.

## Challenges & Solutions

Initially, we faced a lack of a comprehensive dataset. We adapted by using data from a single individual's past blood tests and planned future expansion. We navigated challenges around data privacy and ethical considerations, laying a strong foundation for Tyro's future development.

## Learning & Achievements

Our participation in the AI4Good Lab was a rich learning experience. We gained insights into thyroid health, advanced our understanding of AI and ML models, and honed our skills in UI-UX design. Despite collaborating across different time zones and disciplines, we stayed motivated and proud of our final product.

## Future Directions

Although we are pursuing diverse career paths, we have envisioned numerous enhancements for Tyro. Future developments could include broader data collection, incorporation of natural language processing, and a community-sharing feature. If anyone is interested in continuing our project, we welcome collaboration.
